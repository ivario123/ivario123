Software engineering student at LTU in Sweden and hobbyist/summer-time embedded rust engineer. 

Notable contributions:
- [atsamx7x-rust](https://github.com/atsams-rs/atsamx7x-rust) A rust native hardware abstraction layer for the  Microchip SAM S70/E70/V70/V71 MCUs.
- [Mytikas](https://github.com/Mytikas-LTU/Mytikas) At Mytikas I was the software team lead during 2020-2021 tasked with system design and recruiting. Mytikas is a rocket project at LTU, aiming to launch a hybrid rocket.


My interests are in embedded real-time systems as well as low-level programming as a whole.
